I lost my api notes that Mike and I were working on. Trying to recreate the apis that my writings on the wall app will need.




Various general Data pieces collected:

-user info
	-login name :	string
	-password	:	string
	-email		:	string


-Information In a Message/tweet thing
	-poster's username	
	-poster's geolocation at the time of posting
	-date
	-title? (if we plan to use a title)
	-message
	//image
	//image thumbnail
	//video
		--//  shows if it is present 


-browse query info (needed to pull results) the request info?
	-geolocation of user
	-radius of which to pull messages
	-date range
	-keywords (words or characters in a title or message)

		|
		|	-A calculation off of the latitudes and longitudes is done to calculate which
		|	messages are within a particular specified radius
		|			The calculation would look something like this I imagine:
		|				-req:   lat: 55 (y axis)   long: 30 (x axis) (getting lat long coordinates), let's call lat = b, 					& long = a
		|				-convert desired radius pull , ex 5 miles, into lat long units (degrees?), we'll call this 						variable r
		|				-if I remember correctly, equation for a circle is
		|					(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2
		|				-so in our example, the message location has to been within the desired radius, so..
		|					-(x-30)^2 + (y-55)^2 < (converted 5mi)^2
		|					-x & y in this equation will be the posting's coordinates
		|					-So as long as (x-30)^2 + (y-55)^2  is less than the conversion of 5miles squared, it would 					be shown in the results
		|
		|	
		|	-Messages are also filtered on the specified date range
		|	
		|	-Messages filtered on search terms, if used
	   \ /

-infomation pulled from a query  --- the response?
	{
	-poster's username
	-geolocation (represented as either a pin on a map in mapview, or described by the nearest city in list view)
	-date posted
	-title
	-message
	//image
	//image thumbnail
	//video
	} This information is repeated for every post that meets the criteria of the query
